# 1st Example - Addition

# First_Number = int(input("Enter First Number: "))
# Second_Number = int(input("Enter Second Number: "))
# print(First_Number)
# print(Second_Number)
# Total_Sum = First_Number + Second_Number

# 2nd Example - Addition with Decimal numbers

# First_Number = float(input("Enter the 1st Number: "))
# Second_Number = float(input("Enter the 2nd Number: "))

# 5th Example - Division with Decimal numbers

# First_Number = float(input("Enter the 1st Number: "))
# Second_Number = float(input("Enter the 2nd Number: "))
